    Name: Shaquill Sonny Chea
    Date: 11-30-17
    Purpose: The point of this project of mine is to finally start my website.
    Which is gonna basically be my resume and keep track of what I'm up to. Over
    the course of the time building it I'll gather influence from other websites
    to apply to my own.
